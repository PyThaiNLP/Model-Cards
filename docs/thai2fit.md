**Training Data**

Thai Wikipedia Dump last updated February 17, 2019

**Evaluation Data**

Thai Wikipedia Dump by using 40M/200k/200k tokens of train-validation-test split

**Quantitative Analyses**

perplexity is `28.71067` with 60,005 embeddings at 400 dimensions

**Ethical Considerations**

This language model is based on the Thai Wikipedia Dump (include bias from Thai Wikipedia).
